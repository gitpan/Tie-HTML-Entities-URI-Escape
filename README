NAME
    Tie::HTML::Entities - Scalars tied to HTML encoding
    Tie::URI::Escape - Scalars tied to URI escaping

REQUIREMENTS
    "Tie::HTML::Entities" and "Tie::URI::Escape" should work on Perl
    5.005 but they were written and tested on v5.6.1.

    They use the "HTML::Entities" and the "URI::Escape" modules,
    respectively.

  Installation

    Installation is pretty standard:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

SYNOPSIS
      use Tie::HTML::Entities;

      my  $text;
      tie $text, 'Tie::HTML::Entities', param("text");

      print "Content-Type: text/html\n\n",
         "<body>", $text, "</body>";

DESCRIPTION
    These modules are an experiment with using tied scalars to auto-
    magically escape HTML form input.
